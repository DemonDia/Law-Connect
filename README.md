## Project Description
Our solution is a website that allows junior lawyers to request mentorships directly from senior lawyers with ease. Mentors can be chosen based on their specific skills, ensuring clarity for mentees. By eliminating bureaucratic intermediaries like HR departments, our technology-driven approach increases access to mentorship opportunities and promotes sustained mentorship for junior lawyers.

## Demo
 - Live site: https://law-connect-gilt.vercel.app/

## Features
Here are the key features of the project:
1. Authentication: Supports both email and Gmail authentication for a fast and secure login experience.
2. Onboarding: Seamless onboarding where law firms can see their applicants' profile instantly, thus speeding up the screening process
3. Mentorship networks: Mentees (junior lawyers) can look for mentors (senior lawyers) within the same law firm to guide them in improving their skillsets based on their specific needs.
4. Mentorship monitoring: Mentees and mentors can work closely with each other by monitoring progress and awarding badges of acknowledgement when mentee achieves their skillsets.
