## Project Description
Our solution is a website that allows junior lawyers to request mentorships directly from senior lawyers with ease. Mentors can be chosen based on their specific skills, ensuring clarity for mentees. With a technology-driven approach that increases access to mentorship opportunities and promotes sustained mentorship for junior lawyers.

## Demo
 - Live site: https://law-connect-gilt.vercel.app/

## Features
Here are the key features of the project:
1. Authentication: We support both traditional email & password login, alongside Google Authentication!
2. Goal-focused learning: Junior lawyers indicate the skills they want to learn during signup.
3. User oriented focus: The platform filters potential mentors based on the desired skills of the mentees.
4. Industrial alignment: The platform focuses on competencies listed in the IP Law SkillsFuture Framework.
5. Guide repository: Mentees have access to law guides provided by their mentors in the same firm

## Future Improvements
- Singpass Integration for more seamless experience during authentication
- Expansion into other specialised law fields
